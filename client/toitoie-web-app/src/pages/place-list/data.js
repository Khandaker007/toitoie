    description:
      'Chittagong is a fairly big, spread out town, and the largest international seaport in the country. Like Dhaka, the streets are filled with masses of rickshaws, though the city puts in a little more effort to keep its streets and sidewalks clean. Foreigners will notice a distinct increase in nuisances from beggars in certain intersections: for example, New Market Circle and the central Railway Station. The majority of the beggars are from other parts of the country such as Greater Mymensingh Region and Greater Noakhali area. They have migrated due to the fact that Chittagonian people are more prone to charity relative to other parts of the country. The busiest part of town is the area around the train station and Station Road, while things get a little more bearable as you move further north. GEC Circle is the intersection of Zakir Hossain Rd, O. R. Nizam Rd and CDA Avenue, about 3 km north of the train station, and is the center of middle to upper class life with a variety of shady restaurants and shopping.',

    description:
      'The Sylhet Valley is formed by a beautiful, winding pair of rivers named the Surma and the Kushiara both of which are fed by innumerable hill streams from the north and the south. The valley has a good number of haors which are big natural depressions. During winter, these haors are vast stretches of green land, but in the rainy season, they turn into turbulent seas. These haors provide a sanctuary to the millions of migratory birds who fly from Siberia across the Himalayas to avoid the severe cold there. Sylhet has also a very interesting and rich history, Before the conquest by the Muslims, it was ruled by local chieftains. In 1303, the great Saint Hazrat Shah Jalal came to Sylhet from Yemen with a band of 360 disciples to preach Islam and defeated the then Raja Gour Gobinda.',

Cox’s Bazar is considered as having the longest sea beach in the world, with a total of 121 kilometer long. The name Cox’s Bazar was derived from its founder, Captain Cox. He founded the very attractive beach in 1798. Then the Cox’s Bazar beach started only as a small port and health resort. Though the beach is considered to be the longest beach in the world, it has been the least crowded among the other beaches. Here, visitors can enjoy the relaxing breeze of the Bay of Bengal Sea and the peacefulness of the place. The Cox’s bazar beach certainly has the finest leisure it can offer to each of its visitors.
